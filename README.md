# Pro-Ductivity
A productivity addon for Firefox
How the extension is supposed to work:
The user inputs some time like 5 minutes, the popup counts down from that and when it's done warps the page so that the user is forced to exit.

What it does now:
When you click set timer it warps the page. I hope to finish it soon but it's not easy to find information about the intricacies of Firefox addons, like relaying user input and updating the popup so it might take a while.
