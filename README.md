# Pro-Ductivity
A productivity addon for Firefox.
Built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS

### Details
1. On installing this extension for Firefox, you will see it's logo in the browser toolbar.
2. On clicking the icon, a page opens which allows you to set a time.
3. Once the time has elapsed the extension rotates the page you set the timer for, forcing you to close the tab.

### The Process
I wanted to control the amount of time I spend on youtube and other websites so I built this extension. It took a lot of effort and quite a while to learn how to build an extension for firefox becuase there are hardly any tutorials. I taught myself how to do it by looking at the example extensions on mdn's github page.

### Next Steps
I need an intermediary JavaScript file so that even if you close the popup on the toolbar the alarm will still work.
