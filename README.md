# Pro-Ductivity
A productivity addon for Firefox.
How the extension is supposed to work:
The user inputs some time like 5 minutes, the popup counts down from that and when it's done warps the page so that the user is forced to exit.


I hope to finish it soon but it's my first Firefox extension project so I'm still learning the intricacies OF Firefox extensions.
